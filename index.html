    <h1>NCSU Competitive Programming</h1>

    <p class="lead">
      Competitive programming at NC State is all about problem
      solving.  We hold weekly practice sessions, where we get to
      try out lots of different types of problems.  A few times
      each year, we get to compete with other students on campus,
      with other universities in our region or with schools from all
      over the world. This one of the activities of the student
      ACM / AITP chapters, and our weekly practice meetings and
      our local contests are open to all students.
    </p>

    <h1>Spring 2025 Contests</h1>

      <p>
      </p>

      <!--
      <h2>North American Qualifier</h2>

      <p>
        The North American Qualifier contest will be held on October
        4.  It's a 5-hour contest and we will be participating
        individually.  This is an online contest and registration is
        free.  I'm not yet sure when the registration deadline is, but
        I'm guessing it will be around September 26.
      </p>

      <h2>Mid-Atlantic Regional</h2>
      
      <p>
        The mid-atlantic regional programming contest is a 5-hour
        contest that will be held
        Saturday, November 8.  We expect to send two or three teams
        of three students each to the contest.  Registration dates
        have not been announced yet, but we will probably need to
        register our teams by some time around the start of October.
        I'd expect between 120 and 160 teams from North Carolina,
        Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania.
      </p>
      
      <h2>North American Championship</h2>
      
    <p>
      The best teams from the regional programming contest will be
      able to advance to the North American Championship contest in
      the spring.  This is a contest of about 50 teams, and it will
      take place around the same time as spring break.  This is
      usually a multi-day event, with some training events as well as
      a 5-hour contest.
    </p>
      
    <h1>Register for the fall 2017 Contest</h1>

    <p>
      The fall 2017 contest is on October 7, from 9:30 to 4:00
      in Daniels Hall (rooms 200 and 255).  

      If you want to
      compete, you'll need to <b>register by Sunday, October 1</b>.
      Start by filling out the short google form
      right <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTefqEK8iLdvDioacl3xmmsyO55TFvj9939RNN-JniuUFM5w/viewform">here</a>.

      For our local contest, we're running one site of the North
      American Qualifier contest.  Although you'll just be
      competing against students at NC State for Prizes, you'll
      also be able to see how you did against students from all
      over the continent.
    </p>

    <p>
      See below for more information about the contest.

    <h2>Competitive Programming Practice</h2>

    <p>
      We have a weekly practice meeting on Monday evenings from 5:20
      to 7:10.  It's open to all students.  We're meeting in room
      1203A in EB2.  It's the room right outside the Port City Java on
      the first floor.  The room requires card access, but
      Dr. Sturgill will be there at the start of practice to let you
      in.
    </p>

    <p>
      For practice, we typically use the online problem library
      at <a href="https://open.kattis.com">Open Kattis</a>.  This
      system is often used to host the North American Qualifier
      contest and at the Regional contest.  Plus, it has a library of
      a few thousands of problems we can practice with.
    </p>

    <p>
      This week, we talked about DFS traversal for an undirected
      graph, along with finding bridges and articulation points as an
      application of DFS.  I made
      some <a href="slides/graph/Bridges.pdf">slides</a>
      to help talk through these algorithms.

    <h2>Last Week's Problems</h2>
    
    <p>
      Last week, we looked at problems that could be solved with a
      Fenwick tree data structure.  There's a
      some <a href="slides/data-structure/FenwickTree.pdf">slides
      Presentation</a> to demonstrate the operation of the data
      structure and recorded a
      short <a href="https://youtu.be/y2-kSnb4-oU">video</a> to talk
      through the slides.

    <h2>Practice Attendance</h2>

    <p>
      If you attended practice, please fill out the following very
      short form.  This is just an easy to keep up with who's
      participating and to maintain a contact list.

    <h2>About Competitive Programming</h2>

    <p>
      Competitive programming is a fun way to learn algorithms and
      programming techniques, develop skill in design and implementation, and
      learn to communicate and work effectively in a team.  The activity is
      focused on problem solving.  Participants start with one or more problem
      descriptions, like this <a href="examples/Balloons.pdf">Balloons Problem</a>
      or this <a href="examples/LowToner.pdf">Low Toner Problem</a>.
      Working from the description, they try to design and implement a working
      solution; they just try to do it more quickly than anyone else.
    </p>

    <h2>Preparing for Competition</h2>

    <p>
      When you're preparing for your first competation, it's important
      to make sure you've seen a variety of different problems in
      various areas.  This can help make sure you've seen some of the
      most common algorithms and programming techniques that might
      show up.  It will also give you a chance to develop and refine
      a code library that can speed up the solution of future
      problems.
    <p>

    <p>
      The list below is an attempt to cover various types of problems
      you'll want to try, along with an example or two of that type of
      problem on Kattis.  I'll be filling this in gradually, as we
      cover more problems in our meetings.
